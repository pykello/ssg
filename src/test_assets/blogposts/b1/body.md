Mathematics is a beautiful language that helps us understand the world around us. From simple arithmetic to complex calculus, math provides us with tools to solve problems and make predictions.

### Key Areas of Mathematics

- **Algebra**: Working with symbols and rules for manipulating these symbols
- **Geometry**: Study of shapes, sizes, and properties of space
- **Calculus**: Study of continuous change and motion
- **Statistics**: Collection and analysis of data

```python
# Simple Python function to calculate factorial
def factorial(n):
        if n == 0:
                return 1
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```
